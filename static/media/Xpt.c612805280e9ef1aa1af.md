## Excess Passenger Time

Calculated by taking the excess travel time and multiplying it by the passenger load for each stop-to-stop segment. The excess passenger time is averaged per bus trip then summed per day, to get a daily excess passenger time. The thresholds for the excess passenger time are shown below:

| Grade | Threshold  |
| :---: | :--------: |
|   A   |   < 1.0    |
|   B   | 1.0 - 3.6  |
|   C   | 3.6 - 12.8 |
|   D   | 12.8 - 40  |
|   E   |  40 - 67   |
|   F   |    > 67    |
