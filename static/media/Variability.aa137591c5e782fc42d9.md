## Variability

Calculated by taking the ratio of the standard deviation of travel time to a reference standard deviation, based on average travel time, for each stop-to-stop segment. The standard deviation is taken per trip, then averaged across each time period. The final variability metric is the average standard deviation divided by the reference standard deviation. The thresholds for the variability metric are shown below:

| Grade | Threshold | Description |
| :---: | :-------: | :---------: |
| A	| < 1.4	    | Highly reliable, corresponding to a bus system under effective centralized control and operating without interference from highway traffic. |
| B	| 1.4 - 2.7 | Very reliable, corresponding to a bus system operating at grade, largely without interference from highway traffic in reserved rights of way where appropriate. |
| C 	| 2.7 - 3.8 | Reliable, corresponding to a service operating predominantly in mixed traffic, with effective centralized control, effective traffic signal priority, and no critically congested route segments. |
| D 	| 3.8 - 5.1 | Reasonably reliable, corresponding to a service operating predominantly in mixed traffic with some critically congested route segments and/or without effective traffic signal priority or centralized control. Some customers will plan to leave early to arrive at their destination on time. |
| E	| 5.1 - 8.0 | Marginally reliable, corresponding to a service operating on congested routes without TSP or effective centralized control. Most customers will plan to leave early to arrive at their destination on time. |
| F 	| > 8.0     | Unreliable, corresponding to a service with critical shortcomings due to traffic congestion, lack of centralized control, or other factors. Customers may choose to travel by alternative methods. |
