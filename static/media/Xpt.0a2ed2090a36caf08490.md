## Excess Passenger Time

Calculated by taking the excess travel time and multiplying it by the passenger load for each stop-to-stop segment. The excess passenger time is averaged per bus trip then summed per day, to get a daily excess passenger time. The thresholds for the excess passenger time are shown below:
