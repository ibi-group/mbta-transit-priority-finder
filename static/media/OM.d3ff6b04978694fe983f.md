## Operations and Maintenence

There are two components to the operations and maintenance cost metric: vehicle-hours and vehicle-miles. We used historical data from 2019 and 2021 to determine the operating costs. The costs for each component are an estimate of expenses using average passenger loads.

### Vehicle-Hours

The daily number of vehicles operating on the segment \* the travel time for each vehicle

### Vehicle-Miles

The daily number of vehicles operating on the segment \* distance in miles of the segment

### Cost function

Cost = (vehicle-hours \* $103.53) + (vehicle-miles \* $8.06)
