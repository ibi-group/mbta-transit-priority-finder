## Travel Time

Calculated by taking the ratio of travel time to a reference travel time, based on the distance traveled, for each stop-to-stop segment.

The travel time metric is averaged per bus trip then averaged by AM and PM peak periods with the average of the AM and PM peak being the final value.

The thresholds for the travel time metric are shown below:

| Grade | Threshold |                                                                                                                  Description                                                                                                                   |

|   A   |   < 1.1   |                                                             Representative of service without traffic or traffic signals, when operating on a direct route, at or under capacity.                                                              |
|   B   | 1.1 - 1.5 | Representative of semi-rapid at-grade light rail transit or bus rapid transit operating on a direct route, predominantly in arterial corridors in exclusive or reserved right-of-way, subject to traffic signal control, at or under capacity. |
|   C   | 1.5 - 2.0 |                                                          Representative of service in mixed traffic on a direct route with relatively little impact from general traffic congestion.                                                           |
|   D   | 2.0 - 2.6 |                                                                              Representative of mixed traffic with modest impact from general traffic congestion.                                                                               |
|   E   | 2.6 - 3.6 |                        Representative of mixed traffic on an indirect or ciruitous route with moderate congestion, on a direct route with significant traffic congestion, or on a route operating at or over capacity.                         |
|   F   |   > 3.6   |                                                                                    Unsatisfactory. Perceived as so slow as to not be a good travel choice.                                                                                     |
