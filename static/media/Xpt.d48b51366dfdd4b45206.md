## Excess Passenger Time

Calculated by taking the excess travel time and multiplying it by the passenger load for each stop-to-stop segment.

The excess passenger time is averaged per bus trip then summed across the AM and PM peak periods.

The thresholds for the excess passenger time are shown below:
